Ans 2. Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.

Code Snippet:
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Signal handler to check thread identity
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler thread:", threading.current_thread().name)

# Code that triggers the signal
print("Main thread:", threading.current_thread().name)
user = User.objects.create(username='testuser')

Output:
Main thread: MainThread
Signal handler thread: MainThread
